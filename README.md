# Optimal-Stopping
# Code is from Guan, Lee, Vandekerckhove (2015), data from Burns et al. (2006)

# 98 subjects completed the same 40 5-point and 40 10-point optimal stopping problems, but in different orders
# unconstrain.txt is the graphical model code for the saturated threshold model, in which each threshold is estimated independently.
# bias_indep_probit.txt is the graphical model code for the bias-from-optimal threshold model, with the thresholds estimated as biases from the optimal threshold, but independently for the two tasks, so that there are two alphas, betas, and gammas per participant.
# bias_joint_probit.txt is the graphical model code for the bias-from-optimal threshold model, with the thresholds estimated as biases from the optimal threshold, but jointly across the two tasks, so that there is a single alpha, beta, and gamma per participant.
